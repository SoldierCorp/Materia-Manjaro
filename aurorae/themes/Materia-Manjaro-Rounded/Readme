This is the rounded version and it does look better however if you use the blur effect you may notice some glitches. This is the reason I had removed it for a while but I can't find anything that looks as good as it does so I just disable blur and use it like that. The theme really doesn't require blur effect anyways. I have included the regular Materia Manjaro Aurorae theme and it does work fine with blur but it does not have rounded corners so you can choose from now on. Sorry I wish it all worked perfect too but hey what does works perfect.
